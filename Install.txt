ZZmon installation
------------------

- Remove the boot jumper on the Z280RC board.

- Connect the Z280RC to the PC via the USB adapter and power it with 5V
  supply as usual.

- Start your favorite terminal program and connect to the Z280RC serial
  adapter (under Linux it will be /dev/ttyUSB0 or so).

- Press the reset button on the Z280RC board to ensure the Z280 CPU is
  ready to accept the serial boot program. Nothing will appear on the
  screen.

- From your favorite terminal program, send the loadngo.run file using
  binary mode:

    TinyLoad 1.1
    G xxxx when done
    ........................................................................
    ........................................................................
    ........................................................X

    TinyZZ Monitor v2.0 12-Apr-2020


    >

- Use the C command to copy the boot loader and ZZmon to the Compact Flash.

- Restore the boot jumper and reset the board.


Notes:

- Sometimes the CF hangs when removing/replacing the boot jumper and either
  ZZmon cannot be saved with the C command or the board will not boot again
  even after pressing the reset button. In that case recycling power restores
  operation.

- Sometimes sending the loadngo.run file is too fast for the z280rc to handle;
  in that case you can try adding a small delay after each byte sent (if your
  terminal program supports such option), or you can do the transfer in two
  steps:

   1) send the loadngo.bin file.
   2) at the 'TinyLoad' prompt, send the zzmon.hex file.
