Changelog
---------

27/07/18

- COUTdone removed (not necessary to wait for character to be output
  before switching I/O page).

- Code optimizations, e.g.
    ex de,hl  instead of  ld l,e + ld h,d
    or a      instead of  cp 0
    jr xxx    instead of  jp xxx (where applicable)
    djnz ...  where applicable

- Better HEXOUT routine.

- HEX file checksum check done by 'add b' instead of 'neg a + cp b'

- CIN calls COUT to echo the character, instead of sending it directly to
  the UART TX port (TX might be busy, although unlikely).


03/04/20

- Boot RSX280 option.

- G command calls (instead of jumping to) the user program.


04/04/20

- Prevent endless loop of D command when end adress is FFFF.

12/04/20

- Boot UZI280 option (requires installing a suitable bootloader on block 0
  of the UZI partition).
