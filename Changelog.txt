Changelog
---------

27/07/18

- COUTdone removed (not necessary to wait for character to be output before
  switching I/O page).

- Code optimizations, e.g.
    ex de,hl  instead of  ld l,e + ld h,d
    or a      instead of  cp 0
    jr xxx    instead of  jp xxx (where applicable)
    djnz ...  where applicable

- Better HEXOUT routine.

- HEX file checksum check done by 'add b' instead of 'neg a + cp b'

- CIN calls COUT to echo the character, instead of sending it directly to
  the UART TX port (TX might be busy, although unlikely).


03/04/20

- Boot RSX280 option.

- G command calls (instead of jumping to) the user program.


04/04/20

- Prevent endless loop of D command when end adress is FFFF.

- Allow ending E command with a dot as well as with an 'X'.


12/04/20

- Boot UZI280 option (requires installing a suitable bootloader on block 0
  of the UZI partition).


11/03/21

- Allow 16-bit track number in R command.


09/17/21 v2.2 by Tony Nicholson

- Detect a zero-length Intel HEX type 0 data record (emitted by various CP/M
  assemblers instead of a end-of-file type 1 record type). This prevents a
  stray zero-length record from incorrectly trying to process 256 bytes of
  data. Loading an Intel HEX input stream will now exit when it sees the
  :00xxxx01yy end-of-file type 1 record, or when an 'X' character is entered.

- Optimise code-size by using relative jumps where possible


09/18/21 v2.3 by Tony Nicholson

- CompactFlash disk formatting of drives A:, B:, C: and D: for CP/M using
  the XA, XB, XC and XD commands now clears 80h sectors in case a larger
  number of directory entries is being used.
